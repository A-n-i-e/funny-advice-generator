## Funny Advice Generator app

I know I said I dropped frontend, yes I did butt I thought it would be fun to learn React and know a bit of both frontend and backend so I can build my own cool stuff.

After taking a really great tutorial by BroCode on YouTube, I took on a task from Frontend Mentor to check out what I have learned.

I used ReactJS and got the advice data from **Advice Slip JSON API**. ðŸš€

I learnt how to use components in React and how to access JSON data from an API!

I'm very happy with the build even though it's so simple!
